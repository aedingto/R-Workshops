Practice Exercises for Workshop 1
Feel free to copy the code / answer below the question if that's helpful to you
Or feel free to just these exercises to guide your exploration (no one is grading you!)

1) You want to simulate the outcome of 50 random coin tosses. How could you do this in R?

2) You want to compare your data to normally distirbtued data with mean = 0 and sd = 1. 
How would you sample 100 values from a normal distribution of mean 0 and sd 1?
Hint: Use the rnorm function. Use ?rnorm for help on how to use it!

3) Download and import the "Anopheles_Counts.csv" data set. Save it as a variable in R called "Anopheles"
This dataset contains information about the number of Anopheles quadrimaculatus (the malaria vector in eastern US) at various sites in Florida
The "value" column indicates how many mosuqitoes were found in the trap at that day/location.

3.1) What is the average number of mosquitoes found at all traps/locations?

3.2) What is the max number of mosquitoes found? 

CHALLENGE: At which location did this max value of mosquitoes occur?
  Hint: look-up the 'which' function

3.2) Create a new variable called Locations and set it equal to the 5th column (sample_location_info)

3.2.1) How many unique locations were sampled?
