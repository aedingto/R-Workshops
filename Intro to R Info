Welcome to R! 

You are now joining the ~1-2 million users worldwide enjoying the wonders of R. 

In today's workshop, we will cover:

1) The layout/functionality of R Studio

3) How to install packages
4) How to import data
5) How to assign variables
5) How to access subsets of data



1) R Studio Layout: 
  Console: everything you type here gets executed (or run) 
  Script window: VERY IMPORTANT. USE THIS AND THIS ONLY THIS TO BUILD CODE
  Environment & history: Where you can see the variables you've created and past code you've run
  Plot/Packages/Files tab: Where you can see help info, install packages, and view plots
  
  
2) Functions in R 
   How you communicate to R what you are trying to make it do
   Base R has many many functions already! Examples: mean, subset, plot
   Use functions by typing the name of the function and adding arguments within the parantheses
